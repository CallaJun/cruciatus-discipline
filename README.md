# Cruciatus Discipline
A Google Chrome extension that plays Snape soundbites when if you procrastinate on Facebook (or other userspecified, time-wasting websites).

#Objectives

 - Get user's current URL (DONE)
 - Create folder with several Snape mp3 soundbites
 - If user is on Facebook (DONE)
	 - play random soundbite from folder
	 - start some sort of timer, which times how long the user is on Facebook (and if the user navigates to another page on Facebook, the timer continues as long as their current url is facebook.com. Note: later, we will need to make sure this works if they have many different tabs.)
	 - make sound play every 1 minute (based on timer)
 - Create popup where user can turn feature on or off
 - Add feature allowing user to set many websites on which the feature should work.
 - Add feature allowing user to set intervals for when sounds play (other than 1 minute)
